    <p>...just kidding, this was a web page all along of course :)<br>
        This is my collection of Bookmarks about useful development tools and nerdy projects.<br>
        I collect all this stuff with various browsers while surfing the net, then I use <a href="http://www.xmarks.com/" target="_blank" title="Xmarks - bookmarks sync tool">Xmarks</a> extensions to automagically sync them on all my devices and browsers, desktop and mobile alike.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The extra nice thing about Xmarks is that specific bookmarks folders can be made public and available to ajax requestes.</p>
    <p>This web page uses backbone with requirejs and is shaped mainly with the AMD modules pattern, it is also a CSS experiment to try out the full capacity of the CSS table properties algorithms.</p>
